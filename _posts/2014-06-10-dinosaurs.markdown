<h1>First post!</h1> <br>
<h3>...kind of.</h3>

<p>So this is the reboot of my blog. Right now things aren't exactly as i'd like them to be regarding the layout. I've had some issues so far, mostly due to having no experience with jekyll. Initially I tried to make changes to the structure of the blog by editing the HTML directly, but I guess jekyll automatically generates the html templates somehow, because any direct changes i've made get reverted upon refreshing. Frustrating! So if you click on a link, or button, and it takes you somewhere you didn't expect... Well, I'll work on getting that fixed soon.</p>

<p>But no matter! I've got the basic frame laid out. I'll tie up the loose ends at a later date when I have some more time available. What i'd really like is to be able to focus on generating some content for this blog. I had a post about my first impressions of the flask framework on my previous blog, I'll try to get that up and backdate it soon.</p>

<h4>What's coming?</h4>

<p>I plan to write detailed posts about the things that I learn in a way that is as accessible as possible to other new programmers. I think this will be a useful exercise and help me examine my own thinking. And just maybe, someone else out there will find it useful too. We'll see.</p>
