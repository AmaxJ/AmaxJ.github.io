<h1>First post!</h1> <br>


<p>So I've had a couple of issues getting everything set up, but now I think I've almost got everything how I want it. I'm beginnning to get the hang of jekyll and I think it's a pretty cool little platform. I'll probably continue to tinker with things as I get more familiar with it, so expect changes! Currently there are still a few loose ends, and also some things are still set to the theme's defaults, but I plan to tackle those soon and get everything sorted.</p>

<h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>

<p>I don't have a very significant online presence. My twitter account, which I opened in 2009, has a grand total of 10 tweets. My facebook account is also pretty quiet. That being said, I will make an effort to regularly update this blog. I think it will be a good exercise and force me to examine my own thinking on different subjects, and there's no better way to analyze a thought process than to put it on paper (or on screen rather!)<p>

<p>My focus will primarily be on things related to web development and technology, although I won't necessarily chain myself to those topics. I'll try to discuss the things I'm working on, and if someone else finds anything I've written to be helpful then I will consider this exercise to be a success.</p>

<p>So that's all for my first post. I hope to get into some interesting things in the near future.</p>
